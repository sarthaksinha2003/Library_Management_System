# Readme

Please follow the instructions below to set up the repository for notes and mini full-stack projects:

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a root folder called `projects` in your drive. Preferably, do not use the `C` drive in Windows.
2. Pin the `projects` folder to Quick Access in the File Explorer.
3. Inside the `projects` folder, create a folder called `gla24`.
4. Clone the repository into the `gla24` folder. It should contain two folders:
   1. `notes`
   2. `web` - Contains the front-end React code.
   3. `api` - Contains the back-end Python Flask code.
   4. `screenshots` - Contains the screenshots of the project.

## 1. Notes
1. Each team member should copy the folder template named `univregno-last4-digitX<name-firstname-max10char-lowercase-with-no-space`, paste it, and rename it according to the specified format.
   Example: `1000Xsivaraj`
2. Keep all your digital notes in this folder and commit the changes to the repository on a regular basis.
3. Do not modify or disturb other team members' folders in the repository.

### Git Branch Structure Should be followed for the mini full-stack project:

1. `main` - For the final code.
2. `development` - Team members can raise PRs (pull requests) and merge them here. This branch contains the latest code, which team members can fetch and work on.
3. `<team-member>` - Each team member can create a branch with their name and work on the code. Once the code is ready, they can raise a PR to the `development` branch.
